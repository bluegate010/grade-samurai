* This is a Web-based turnin and grading system.
* Student workflow
** Create an account
*** Log in with BYU NetID
*** Input first name, last name, email, and picture
** Dashboard
*** Current grade stats (min, average, max, max opt)
*** Shows grade states for the class (min, median, average, max)
*** Next assignments that are due
*** Past assignment grades
** Submitting future assignments
*** First you submit the file(s)
*** If it is a program, it is run in a sandbox and the output is collected
*** Once the deadline has passed, you must come back to grade it (by filling out a survey)
*** The survey asks a question and the answer is either multiple choice, free-form, or select a line
*** Only then is it sent to me
** Viewing old grades
*** Shows each question with my answer/comment
*** Allows a comment/discussion about each point

* Grader workflow
** No need to create an account
*** The account is hard-coded in, independent of NetID
*** This may be a problem for Bryan who will want to split the work with a student
** Dashboard
*** Shows grade states for the class (min, median, average, max)
*** Allows me to look at the grades of each student in a chart + detail (ability to change grades)
*** Shows assignments that need to be graded
*** Shows comments that need to be responded to (with option of changing a grade)
** Grading
*** Shows the whole program
*** For each question
**** Jumps to a line number they selected
**** I approve or disapprove
**** And optionally can add a comment
*** For non-line number questions, I just approve or disapprove (although maybe I need to allow a number between 0 and 1 to be inputted)
** Comments
*** Shows the program in context
*** Jumps to the line number
*** Shows my previous input on it
*** Allows me to change the grade

* Database
** Filesystem based
** Assignment data is "hard coded" in a library / little language
** students
